Pomodoro App Requirements Document
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements, design, and implementation plan for a Pomodoro productivity tracking application. The application will help users track their work sessions and breaks, providing statistics to improve productivity.

1.2 Scope
This application will consist of a command-line interface (CLI) for initiating Pomodoro sessions, a web interface for monitoring and statistics, and deployment in a Docker container for ease of deployment and scaling.

2. User Personas
2.1 John Doe - The Busy Professional
Age: 35
Occupation: Marketing Manager
Needs: Track productivity, improve work habits, visualize time spent on tasks
Tech Skill: Intermediate
2.2 Jane Smith - The Student
Age: 22
Occupation: University Student
Needs: Manage study sessions, balance study and break time, analyze study patterns
Tech Skill: Beginner
3. User Stories
As a user, I want to start a Pomodoro session from the CLI, so that I can begin working on a task.
As a user, I want to be notified when a Pomodoro session ends, so that I can take a break.
As a user, I want to view my productivity statistics on a web page, so that I can analyze my work patterns.
As a user, I want to track my completed Pomodoro sessions, so that I can see my progress over time.
4. Functional Requirements
Start a Pomodoro Session (CLI)

Input: Task description, session duration
Output: Timer starts, notification when session ends
End a Pomodoro Session (CLI)

Input: Session end command
Output: Session stops, log entry created
View Statistics (Web)

Input: User login
Output: Display charts and graphs of completed sessions, break times, and productivity trends
User Authentication (Web)

Input: Username, password
Output: User login, session management
Docker Deployment

Input: Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration
Output: Deployable Docker containers for CLI and web interface
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Usability

Simple and intuitive CLI commands
User-friendly web interface
Performance

Minimal latency in command execution
Quick loading of web pages
Reliability

Robust error handling in CLI and web interface
Consistent uptime for Docker deployment
Scalability

Ability to handle multiple users concurrently

6. System Architecture
6.1 System Components
CLI Application: Python-based command-line interface for managing Pomodoro sessions.
Web Application: Flask-based web interface for displaying statistics.
Database: SQLite for storing user data and session logs.
Docker: Containerization of both CLI and web application for deployment.
